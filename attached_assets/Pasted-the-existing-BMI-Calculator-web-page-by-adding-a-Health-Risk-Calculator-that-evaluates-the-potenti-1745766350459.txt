the existing "BMI Calculator" web page by adding a Health Risk Calculator that evaluates the potential health risks based on the BMI category.
After calculating the BMI and displaying the corresponding BMI Category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese), display an additional section with:

Health Risk Level based on BMI category (Low, Medium, High).

Health Risk Evaluation:

Underweight (BMI < 18.5):
Risk Level: Low to Medium (Risk of malnutrition, osteoporosis, etc.)

Normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9):
Risk Level: Low (Healthy weight range, minimal health risks)

Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9):
Risk Level: Medium (Increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, etc.)

Obese (BMI ≥ 30):
Risk Level: High (High risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and other serious health conditions)

Requirements:

After the user sees their BMI Category, display the Health Risk Level directly below the BMI category.

For each BMI category, provide a short explanation of the potential health risks:

For Underweight: "Underweight individuals may have a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies and weaker immune systems."

For Normal weight: "A normal BMI indicates a lower risk for heart disease and other health issues."

For Overweight: "Being overweight can increase the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes."

For Obese: "Obesity is associated with a high risk of serious conditions like heart disease, stroke, and hypertension."

Display the Health Risk Level in a clear, easy-to-read format with soft background colors (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high).

Ensure the overall design is clean and user-friendly, with separate sections for BMI and Health Risk.

Optionally, include a link to more information (e.g., lifestyle changes for reducing health risks).

Design Requirements:

Keep the risk levels simple, visually distinguishable, and well-organized.

Use icons or color-coded labels (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high) to visually represent risk.

Use clear, concise language to describe each risk level.

Optional Features:

Allow users to hover or click on the risk level for additional details or health advice.

Optionally include a "See Doctor" recommendation for high-risk individuals.

HTML, CSS (TailwindCSS recommended for styling), and Vanilla JavaScrip
